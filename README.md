# WebsitePart1

This website was made to be interactive, and has many features
Features:
The nav bar buttons turn black when you hover over them, and the logo "OceanGaurdian" acts as a refresher, refreshing the page.
The words below the slogan turn different colors, and a mixture of those, it also changes size and becomes bigger.
The buttons do the same, they also get bigger when you hover over them. If you click and hold, the Brand Logo will appear. 
If you make the browser window smaller, these words will act almost animated, and will take them a second to adjust (an effect)

The Gallery has a animate on scroll effect, using a JS link I found here
https://github.com/michalsnik/aos
The Plastic Effects area has a almost panaromic view, of how you can scroll the bottom scroller and move around the photo. 
There is also a iframe, of a youtube video. 

The contact us slide is pretty ordinary, with not much visual appeals, because it isn't suppose to be distracting. 

I did not have enough time to create the Donate slide, so I linked it to teamseas.
